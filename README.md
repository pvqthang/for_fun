you will need matplotlib library to execute this code
This is nothing but a simple simulation of 3 types of game which is
similar to our society and its outcome.
1. the first game represents a normal distribution where ever players received a random reward between 
0 and N in every game which is similar to monthly income

2. the 2nd one represents pareto distribution where all players join a zero sum game where if they win they
got a random reward between 0 and N
3. the last one is a mix between 1st and 2nd game, all players received a monthy salary plus they play a zero sum game like the 2nd one.
From the results we can see that how different is the outcome of 3 game. In 2nd and 3rd game the standard deviations is relatively high in comparison to 1st game.
